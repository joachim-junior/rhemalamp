                <p>Your subscription entitles you to access an unlimited number of books in the <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>">Rhema-Lamp</a> library during the subscription period. Some Subscription Content may not be immediately available to the small percentage of users that consume an unusually high volume of Subscription Content. <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>">Rhema-Lamp</a> reserves and shall have the right in its sole discretion to add, modify, withdraw, or delay, at any time, any particular Subscription Content from access by You for any reason including, without limitation, based on the costs generated to <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>">Rhema-Lamp</a> by such content or the nature of Your use of the <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>">Rhema-Lamp</a> website. <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>">Rhema-Lamp</a> makes no guarantee as to the availability of specific titles or the timing of their availability.</p>

                <h3>3. PAYMENTS AND BILLING</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Fees, charges, and any materially different terms from those described to you in this Agreement will be disclosed to you at sign-up or in other communications made available to you. When You purchase a Subscription (such purchase, a “Transaction”), we may ask You to supply additional information relevant to Your Transaction, including, without limitation, Your credit card number, the expiration date of Your credit card and Your billing address (such information, “Payment Information”). You represent and warrant that You have the legal right to use all payment method(s) represented by any such Payment Information. When You initiate a Transaction, You authorize us to provide Your Payment Information to third parties so we can complete Your Transaction and to charge Your payment method for the type of Transaction You have selected; You may need to provide additional information to verify Your identity before completing Your Transaction (such information is included within the definition of Payment Information).</li>
                    <li>Subscription prices are displayed in Cameroon France (FCFA.), or, whenever possible, Your equivalent local currency. The currency used to charge You for Your subscription payments depends on the billing country where Your payment method is located. Rhema-Lamp’s pricing differs from country to country and the Subscription fee displayed on Your screen may differ from the final amount charged if You sign up in a country that is different from the home country of Your billing method. Your billing currency may change if You update your payment method or change the country of billing in your Payment information. Your country of billing must match the country where Your payment method is located.
                        <p>By entering into this Agreement, You acknowledge that <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>">Rhema-Lamp</a> reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to convert the displayed currency to that of your billing country or the home country of Your payment method as necessary. You acknowledge that <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>">Rhema-Lamp</a> cannot control any currency conversion or foreign transaction fees that may be charged to You by Your card issuer or bank for Your subscription payment, and You agree to not hold <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>">Rhema-Lamp</a> or its affiliates, contractors, employees, agents, or third-party partners, licensors, or suppliers liable for any such fees.</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>If You choose to purchase an annual or monthly Subscription, You will be charged the annual or monthly Subscription fee at the beginning of the paying portion of Your Subscription and each year or month thereafter, respectively, at the then-current rate. If You choose to purchase an annual Subscription, we will automatically charge You on the anniversary of the commencement of the paying portion of Your Subscription using the Payment Information You have provided. If You elect to purchase a monthly Subscription, we will automatically charge You each month, on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of the paying portion of Your Subscription, using the Payment Information You have provided. In the event Your Subscription began on a day not contained in a given month, we may charge Your payment method on a day in the applicable month or such other day as we deem appropriate. For example, if You started Your Subscription on January 31st, Your next payment date is likely to be February 28th, and Your payment method would be billed on that date.</li>
                    <li>By entering into the Agreement and electing to purchase an annual or monthly Subscription, You acknowledge that Your Subscription has recurring payment features and You accept responsibility for all recurring payment obligations prior to cancellation of Your Subscription by You or <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>">Rhema-Lamp</a>. We may also periodically authorize Your payment method in anticipation of applicable fees or related charges. Your Subscription continues until cancelled by You or we terminate Your access to, or use of, the Services or the Subscription in accordance with this Agreement (and the General Terms of Use which forms part of this Agreement).</li>
                    <li><a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>">Rhema-Lamp</a> may offer a free trial Subscription for a specified period of time. If we offer You a Free Trial, the specific terms of Your Free Trial will be provided at signup and/or in the promotional materials describing the Free Trial. Free Trials may not be combined with any other offer. If you cancel your Free Trial before the expiration of the Free Trial Term, you may be eligible to use any unused portion of such Free Trial Term the next time you sign up for a <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>">Rhema-Lamp</a> Subscription, provided that <a href="<?php echo base_url(); ?>">Rhema-Lamp</a> continues to offer the Free Trial that you were previously offered. Except as may otherwise be provided in the specific terms for the Free Trial offer, Free Trials are only available to users who have not previously completed a Free Trial. Unless You cancel Your Subscription prior to the end of Your Free Trial, we (or our third party payment processor) will begin charging Your payment method on a recurring basis for the Subscription Fee (plus any applicable taxes and other charges) until You cancel Your Subscription. Instructions for cancelling Your Subscription are stated below under the Section titled “Cancellation of Subscriptions.” We reserve the right to modify or terminate Free Trials at any time, without notice and in our sole discretion.</li>
